		What it is:
		<p>The Rovatech - Site Builder is an extremely felxible and scalable mini-framework for developers and design teams without the hassle of a full blown CMS.</p>
		<p>For teams The framework separates structure, functionality, and content. This means that an individual with little to no knowledge of HTML
		will be able to update content with out much learning and that Designers can update structure and content without messing with the functionality.</p>
		<p>For developers this provides a high level of organization with all of the global settings and variable for the web pages stored in PHP scripts. This 
		will also give you peace of mind knowing that your PHP is not getting edited accidentally by other team members.</p>

			working in the Rovatech - Site Builder framework. This can be used just as easily for a large corporate or ecommerce site.</p>
